A generic web app
=================

An app that will include some common capabilities that all modern web apps use. The app may have some simple example functionality to demonstrate functionality.  The current goal is to incorporate each of the following frameworks and libraries:

TODO:

* twitter bootstrap for UX
* MySQL database wrapped by simple rest CRUD API
* deploy with chef server
* deploy with app server nginx and wsgi
* integration with an API to enhance the database object
* auth with some tools such as facebook or linked in

Getting Started:
